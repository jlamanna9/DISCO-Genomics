DISCO-Digital Microfluidic Isolation of Single Cells for - Omics.  
The laser lysis capture method implemented in DISCO offers spatially and temporally resolved capture of single cells, while Digital Microfluidics (DMF) is capable of retrieving this lysate and permitting flexible downstream analyses, such as single cell genomics.

## General Workflow
The provided scripts go through mapping, generating count data, and making figures.
